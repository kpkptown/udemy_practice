            his news is from England. Some children are in hospital. They are sick.
            Three window cleaners want to make the children feel better. They put on superhero costumes. They go on top of the hospital. They come down. They are on ropes.
            The children are sitting near a window. They can see the superheroes through the window. The children are very happy. The window cleaners are happy, too. They like to make the children feel better.
            Difficult words: window cleaner (a person who cleans windows), superhero (a character from a story who has special powers and who helps people).

            Sudan´s prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, travels to his office in the capital city. He travels in a group of cars. It is safer for him. However, somebody attacks the cars.
            Nobody dies in the attack. One security officer must go to hospital.  Hamdok is healthy and safe.
            Political situation in Sudan is very difficult. Last year, Sudan´s president leaves his job. He is a criminal. He must go to court.
            Now, the government wants to change the system in the country. It is not easy. There are many conflicts. Hamdok says that he wants to continue his work.
            Difficult words: prime minister (the leader of a government), court (the place where a group of people decide what happens to somebody who does a bad thing), conflict (when people fight because they have different ideas or they want different things).
